title: Never Draw FC&lt:&gt Bay FC's Path to History
---

Entering Week 18 of their inaugral season Bay FC has 18 points only a point back of Louisville for the last playoff spot with the most wins, 6, of any team among the NWSL's bottom half. How can Bay FC both be a point from the playoffs and have the most wins of any team at below the playoff bubble? They refuse to draw.

In fact their streak of 17 decisive results is the most by any expansion team in the entire history of the NWSL. But just how rare of is it to have a streak of this many games to start a season without a draw?

Not only was this streak incredibly rare in the NWSL but was rare across any Women's Domestic League which has their stats housed by [Sports Reference](fbref.com)[^1]. Across their entire dataset there were only 22 team-seasons without a draw and at least the 17 games Bay FC have played so far.[^2] Of those teams 12 were league conquerors averaging over 2.15 points a game such as the famous 2018-2019 Arsenal team who only lost once a piece to Chelsea and Manchester City on their way to the title. 7 more teams were the exact opposite with under 1 point per game such as 2020-2021 Pink Bari who suffered 21 losses as part of their 1 win campaign and subsequent exit from Serie A. These 19 teams without a draw in their season make sense. The three remaining team-seasons do not.

One of these three teams is 2020-2021 Standard Liege squad that somehow won 15 games and lost 11 during the regular season. Still made the playoffs and incredibly finished their season still without a draw going 1-7-0 in the playoffs before being eliminated.

One of the other squads was the 2018 Hammarby team of the Swedish Damallsvenskan. They went 8-14 finishing 11th before being relegated.

The final one is, you guessed it, Bay FC. It is truly incredible they've made it this far into the season without a draw. Even more so because they're not a special team in the best or worst case of that word. They are simply a team in the mix for the playoffs as the NWSL enters it's stretch run. A team that needs any points possible --- even if it means taking a draw that would prevent them from further carving a space in the NWSL record books.
