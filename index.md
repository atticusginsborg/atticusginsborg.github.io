## About

I'm currently a student at the University of Chicago pursuing my Masters in data science. 
Prior to attending UChicago I graduated magna cum laude with degrees in Data Science from the College of Computing, Data Science, and Society and Economics from the College of Letters and Sciences at Berkeley.  While at Berkeley I was a Lecturer for the [College of Computing, Data Science, and Society](https://cdss.berkeley.edu/) where I taught [Data 6: Introduction to Computational Thinking with Data](https://data6.org/). 
I am originally from San Jose, California.
