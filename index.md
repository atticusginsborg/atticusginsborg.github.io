## About

I'm Atticus and this past summer I was a Lecturer at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) for the [College of Computing, Data Science, and Society](https://cdss.berkeley.edu/) where I taught [Data 6: Introduction to Computational Thinking with Data](https://data6.org/). 

I earned B.A. degrees in Data Science from the College of Computing, Data Science, and Society and Economics from the College of Letters and Sciences at Berkeley. In the fall I will be starting my Masters in Data Science program at UChicago. I am originally from San Jose, California.
