I am currently a student at the University of Chicago pursuing my Masters in data science. Prior to attending UChicago I graduated high distinction with degrees in **Data Science** from the College of Computing, Data Science, and Society and **Economics** from the College of Letters and Sciences at UC Berkeley (2024).  While at Berkeley I was a Lecturer for the [College of Computing, Data Science, and Society](https://cdss.berkeley.edu/) where I taught [Data 6: Introduction to Computational Thinking with Data](https://data6.org/su24). 

This past summer I worked as a research mentor as part of the [Data Science for Social Impact](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/outreach/data-science-for-social-impact-network/summer-experience/2025/) Summer Research Experience at UChicago. Since the start of this year I have also been assisting UChicago professor's Amanda Kube-Jotte and Amy Nussbaum in researching new ways to deliver data science education. I plan on graduating this Fall and am exploring further graduate education and industry opportunities.

## About Me

I am a graduate student born and raised in San Jose, California. Growing up I loved sports but quickly realized I was better at analyzing them than playing them. To explore this interest I took introductory statistics classes where I was frustrated by the fact we were still performing analysis on outdated data. Luckily, I was able to take intro data science at Berkeley where I saw how modern computing tools can empower anyone to both find data on and empirically explore their interests.

However, I quickly realized that "anyone" really meant those who had the time and money to receive exposure to data science as a field. As such I spent much of my time at Berkeley working on developing our intro curriculum which has been shared with schools and universities around the world. I also worked with various entities at Berkeley to increase diversity in data science both in terms of the curriculum and those taking the classes.

More recently I have been using my data science (hypothesis testing, machine learning, nlp) and pedagogical background by conducting research into how best to teach introductory data science as well as gaps in access to data science. Additionally, as data science has an increasing impact on everyday life I think it's important we try to broaden societies baseline understanding of the field and ensure courses of study are offered at more schools. In particular, I have been looking into gaps in data science access at the Community College level which need to be bridged to open up more access to the field within in Higher Ed.

Some of my past affiliations include:
 - Data Intern [National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum](https://baseballhall.org/discover/Shortstops-making-a-fashion-statement)
 - Instructor [Berkeley Splash](https://berkeley.learningu.org/learn/Splash/spring_2022/catalog#class_896)
 - President [Sports Analytics Group at Berkeley](https://sportsanalytics.studentorg.berkeley.edu/)
 - Curriculum Developer - [Tuskegee Scholars Summer Program](https://cdss.berkeley.edu/news/uc-berkeley-and-tuskegee-university-announce-data-science-partnership)
 - Eagle Scout [Troop 220, Scouts BSA](https://www.scouting.org/)
 - Instructor at [UC Berkeley](https://cdss.berkeley.edu/)

Outside of academia you are likely to find me at a sporting event whether it is playing for my grad league softball team (go Runtime Terrors!), watching Chicago's various collegiate and professional teams, or in a time crunch during a blitz chess match. You can find my most recent explorations of the intersection between sports and data on my [blog]({% link blog.md %}). I also love exploring public libraries and indie bookstores (would highly recommend [Hicklebees](https://hicklebees.com/) in San Jose).

## Teaching

Having the opportunity to give back to the Data Science community at Cal, UChicago, and beyond has been a highlight of my academic career. Below is a summary of my teaching positions. I looking forward to staying involved with data science education at UChicago this Fall.

### UC Berkeley

#### Lecturer - [Data 6: Introduction to Computational Thinking with Data](https://data6.org/)

All other teaching at UC Berkeley was for [Data 8: Foundations of Data Science](https://www.data8.org/) where I taught under professors Ani Adhikari, John DeNero, David Wagner, Joey Gonzalez, and lecturer Swupnil Sahai at various points.

#### Lead uGSI (pedagogy, logistics) - [Fall 2023](https://www.data8.org/fa23), [Spring 2024](https://www.data8.org/sp24)

#### uGSI (undergraduate student instructor) - [Summer 2022](https://www.data8.org/su22), [Fall 2022](https://www.data8.org/fa22), [Spring 2023](https://www.data8.org/su23)

#### Tutor - [Fall 2021](https://www.data8.org/fa21), [Spring 2022](https://www.data8.org/sp22)

### UChicago

#### TA - Data 118 Introduction to Data Science I (Kelly Smalenberger)

#### TA - Data 119 Introduction to Data Science II (Amanda Kube-Jotte)

I'm always looking for new ways to broaden access to data science so if you're interested in getting help developing or implementing data science curriculum at your school please reach out!
